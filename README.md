# satellite.nvim

`satellite.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that displays decorated scrollbars.

**NOTE**: Many API's required to implement a decorated scrollbar in Neovim do not yet exist,
and because of this, this plugin implements fairly unideal and unoptimised workarounds to get desired behaviours.
Therefore, this plugin is highly experimental and currently serves as a platform to experiment, investigate and design the required API's that are needed to be implemented in Neovim core.

## Features

* Display marks for different kinds of decorations across the buffer. Builtin handlers include:
  * Search results
  * Diagnostic
  * Git hunks (via [gitsigns.nvim])
  * Marks
* Handling for folds
* Mouse support

## Requirements

Neovim nightly

## Installation

[packer.nvim]:
```lua
use 'lewis6991/satellite.nvim'
```

## Usage

For basic setup with all batteries included:
```lua
require('satellite').setup()
```

If using [packer.nvim] Satellite can be setup directly in the plugin spec:

```lua
use {
  'lewis6991/satellite.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('satellite').setup()
  end
}
```

Configuration can be passed to the setup function. Here is an example with most of
the default settings:

```lua
require('satellite').setup {
  current_only = false,
  winblend = 50,
  zindex = 40,
  excluded_filetypes = {},
  width = 2,
  handlers = {
    search = {
      enable = true,
    },
    diagnostic = {
      enable = true,
      signs = {'-', '=', 'â‰¡'},
      min_severity = vim.diagnostic.severity.HINT,
    },
    gitsigns = {
      enable = true,
      signs = { -- can only be a single character (multibyte is okay)
        add = "â”‚",
        change = "â”‚",
        delete = "-",
      },
    },
    marks = {
      enable = true,
      show_builtins = false, -- shows the builtin marks like [ ] < >
    },
  },
}
```

* The `:SatelliteDisable` command disables scrollbars.
* The `:SatelliteEnable` command enables scrollbars. This is only necessary
  if scrollbars have previously been disabled.
* The `:SatelliteRefresh` command refreshes the scrollbars. This is relevant
  when the scrollbars are out-of-sync, which can occur as a result of some
  window arrangement actions.

## Configuration

There are various settings that can be configured. Please see the documentation
for details.

## Handlers

## Documentation

Documentation can be accessed with:

```nvim

```

## Credit

This plugin was based on [nvim-scrollview] which provides a very good implementation for a normal scrollbar.
