REQUIREMENTS                                          *satellite-requirements*

* Scrollbar mouse dragging requires mouse support (see |'mouse'|) and
  `nvim>=0.7`.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                        *satellite-usage*

For basic setup with all batteries included:
>
    require('satellite').setup()

Configuration can be passed to the setup function. Here is an example with most
of the default settings:
>
    require('satellite').setup {
      current_only = false,
      winblend = 50,
      zindex = 40,
      excluded_filetypes = {},
      width = 2,
      handlers = {
        search = {
          enable = true,
        },
        diagnostic = {
          enable = true,
        },
        gitsigns = {
          enable = true,
        },
        marks = {
          enable = true,
          key =  'm',
          show_builtins = false, -- shows the builtin marks like [ ] < >
        },
      },
    }
<

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                  *satellite-commands*
* The *:SatelliteDisable* command disables scrollbars.
* The *:SatelliteEnable* command enables scrollbars. This is only necessary
  if scrollbars have previously been disabled.
* The *:SatelliteRefresh* command refreshes the scrollbars. This is relevant
  when the scrollbars are out-of-sync, which can occur e.g., as a result of
  some window arrangement actions.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                        *satellite-configuration*

This section describes the configuration fields which can be passed to
|satellite.setup()|.

current_only                                   *satellite-config-current_only*
        Type: `boolean`
        Default: `false`

        Whether satellite should only be displayed in the current window.

excluded_filetypes                       *satellite-config-excluded_filetypes*
        Type: `string[]`
        Default: `[]`

        File types for which scrollbars should not be displayed.

winblend                                           *satellite-config-winblend*
        Type: `integer`
        Default: `50`

        Level of transparency for scrollbars. Must be between `0` (opaque)
        and `100` (transparent).

zindex                                              *satellite-config-zindex*
        Type: `integer`
        Default: `40`

        Z-index for scrollbars.

Highlight Groups ~
                                                *satellite-config-highlights*
The following highlight group can be configured to change |satellite.nvim|'s
colors.

Name         Default   Description
----         -------   -----------
`ScrollView`   `Visual`    Color for the scrollbar

The highlight groups can be customized. Example:
 >
    " Link ScrollView highlight to Pmenu highlight
    highlight link ScrollView Pmenu

    " Specify custom highlighting for ScrollView
    highlight ScrollView ctermbg=159 guibg=LightCyan

Mouse Support (experimental) ~
                                                    *satellite-mouse-support*

A |<LeftMouse>| mapping is automatically created for interactive mouse
support.

ISSUES                                                      *satellite-issues*

* Scrollbars can become out-of-sync after window arrangement actions that are
  not followed by a scroll event. For example, this can be seen by starting
  `nvim`, issuing |:help|, then typing `<ctrl-w>J` to move the help window to
  the bottom of the screen. This could be resolved if there was an event that
  is triggered by the window arrangement actions. |:SatelliteRefresh|, or
  scrolling can be used to refresh the scrollbars.

* Scrollbars become out-of-sync when the mouse wheel is used to scroll a
  non-current window. This is because the |WinScrolled| event only corresponds
  to the current window. The scrollbars can be refreshed with
  |:SatelliteRefresh|, scrolling, or by changing the current window.

* Scrollbars become out-of-sync after fold commands. Because there are no
  |autocmd-events| for folding, the plugin is unable to refresh the
  scrollbars.
