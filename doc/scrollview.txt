|nvim-scrollview| is a plugin that displays interactive scrollbars. The plugin
is customizable (see |scrollview-configuration|).

============================================================================
1. Requirements                            *scrollview-requirements*

* `nvim>=0.5`
* Scrollbar mouse dragging requires mouse support (see |'mouse'|) and
  `nvim>=0.5.2`.

============================================================================
2. Installation                            *scrollview-installation*

Use |packages| or one of the various package managers.

============================================================================
3. Usage                                   *scrollview-usage*

* |nvim-scrollview| works automatically, displaying interactive scrollbars.

                                           *scrollview-commands*
* The *:ScrollViewDisable* command disables scrollbars.
* The *:ScrollViewEnable* command enables scrollbars. This is only necessary
  if scrollbars have previously been disabled.
* The *:ScrollViewRefresh* command refreshes the scrollbars. This is relevant
  when the scrollbars are out-of-sync, which can occur e.g., as a result of
  some window arrangement actions (see |scrollview-issues|).

                                           *scrollview-mappings*
The following |<Plug>| mappings are defined for convenience.

* `<Plug>(ScrollViewDisable)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewEnable)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)`

The following (experimental) |<Plug>| mappings are defined for customizing
mouse functionality (see |scrollview-mouse-customization|).

* `<Plug>(ScrollViewLeftMouse)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewMiddleMouse)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewRightMouse)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewX1Mouse)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewX2Mouse)`

============================================================================
4. Configuration                           *scrollview-configuration*

The following variables can be used to customize the behavior of
|nvim-scrollview|. Variables can be set at the 1) window, 2) tab, 3) buffer,
and/or 4) global scope, with that order of precedence (i.e., window variables
have the highest precedence, and global variables have the lowest).

Configuration Variables ~
                                           *scrollview_auto_mouse*
scrollview_auto_mouse  |Boolean| |Number| specifying whether a mapping is
                       automatically created for mouse support (without
                       clobbering). Defaults to `1`. Considered only at global
                       scope, when the plugin is loaded.

scrollview_auto_workarounds                *scrollview_auto_workarounds*
                       |Boolean| |Number| specifying whether select workarounds
                       are automatically applied for known |scrollview-issues|
                       (without clobbering existing customizations). Defaults
                       to `1`. Considered only at global scope, when the plugin
                       is loaded.

                                           *scrollview_base*
scrollview_base        |String| specifying where the scrollbar is anchored.
                       Possible values are `'left'` or `'right'` for corresponding
                       window edges, or `'buffer'`. Defaults to `'right'`.

                                           *scrollview_character*
scrollview_character  |String| specifying a character to display on scrollbars.
                      Defaults to `''`. Considered only at global scope.
                      Scrollbar transparency (via |scrollview_winblend|) is not
                      possible when a scrollbar character is used.

                                           *scrollview_column*
scrollview_column      |Number| specifying the scrollbar column (relative to
                       |scrollview_base|). Defaults to `2`. Must be an integer
                       greater than or equal to `1`.

scrollview_current_only                    *scrollview_current_only*
                       |Boolean| |Number| specifying whether scrollbars should
                       only be displayed in the current window. Defaults to `0`.
                       Considered only at tab and global scopes.

scrollview_excluded_filetypes              *scrollview_excluded_filetypes*
                       |List| of |String|s specifying optional file types for
                       which scrollbars should not be displayed. Defaults to
                       `[]`.

scrollview_hide_on_intersect               *scrollview_hide_on_intersect*
                      |Boolean| |Number| specifying whether each scrollbar becomes
                      hidden (not shown) when it would otherwise intersect
                      with a floating window. Defaults to `0`.

                                           *scrollview_mode*
scrollview_mode        |String| specifying what the scrollbar position and size
                       correspond to. See |scrollview-modes| for details on the
                       available modes. Defaults to `'virtual'`.

                                           *scrollview_on_startup*
scrollview_on_startup  |Boolean| |Number| specifying whether scrollbars are
                       enabled on startup. Defaults to `1`. Considered only at
                       global scope, when the plugin is loaded.

scrollview_refresh_time                    *scrollview_refresh_time*
                       |Number| specifying the refresh limit. When scrollbar
                       refreshing takes more than this many milliseconds,
                       subsequent refreshing will use `simple` |scrollview_mode|.
                       Defaults to `100`. A value of `-1` corresponds to no limit.
                       Considered only at global scope. To reset the mode
                       behavior, set `g:scrollview_refresh_time_exceeded` to `0`.

                                           *scrollview_winblend*
scrollview_winblend    |Number| specifying the level of transparency for
                       scrollbars. Defaults to `50`. Must be between `0` (opaque)
                       and `100` (transparent).

scrollview_zindex                          *scrollview_zindex*
                       |Number| specifying the scrollbar z-index. Defaults to
                       `40`.

Configuration Example ~
                                           *scrollview-configuration-example*
The variables can be customized in your |init.vim|, as shown in the following
example.
 >
    let g:scrollview_excluded_filetypes = ['nerdtree']
    let g:scrollview_current_only = 1
    let g:scrollview_winblend = 75
    " Position the scrollbar at the 80th character of the buffer
    let g:scrollview_base = 'buffer'
    let g:scrollview_column = 80

Scrollview Modes ~
                                           *scrollview-modes*
The following modes are available for the |scrollview_mode| configuration setting
(set as a |string|). Without closed |folds|, both modes work the same way.

Mode       Description
----       -----------
`simple`     The scrollbar top position reflects the window's top line number
           relative to the document's line count. The scrollbar height
           reflects the size of the window relative to the document's line
           count. Dragging the scrollbars with the mouse may result in
           unresponsive scrolling when there are closed folds.

`virtual`    The scrollbar position and height are calculated similarly to the
           `simple` mode, but line numbers and the document line count are
           implicitly updated to virtual counterparts that account for closed
           folds. The scrollbar top position reflects the window's top virtual
           line number relative to the document's virtual line count. The
           scrollbar height reflects the size of the window relative to the
           document's virtual line count.

Color Customization ~
                                           *scrollview-color-customization*
The following highlight group can be configured to change |nvim-scrollview|'s
colors.

Name         Default   Description
----         -------   -----------
`ScrollView`   `Visual`    Color for the scrollbar

The highlight groups can be customized in your |init.vim|, as shown in the
following example.
 >
    " Link ScrollView highlight to Pmenu highlight
    highlight link ScrollView Pmenu

    " Specify custom highlighting for ScrollView
    highlight ScrollView ctermbg=159 guibg=LightCyan

Mouse Customization (experimental) ~
                                           *scrollview-mouse-customization*
When |scrollview_auto_mouse| is set, a |<LeftMouse>| mapping is automatically
created for interactive mouse support. An existing mapping will not be
clobbered.

Mappings can be used to manually create mappings for mouse support.
 >
    " Add support for dragging scrollbars with the left mouse button
    nmap <leftmouse> <plug>(ScrollViewLeftMouse)
    vmap <leftmouse> <plug>(ScrollViewLeftMouse)
    imap <leftmouse> <plug>(ScrollViewLeftMouse)

    " Add support for dragging scrollbars with the middle mouse button
    nmap <middlemouse> <plug>(ScrollViewMiddleMouse)
    vmap <middlemouse> <plug>(ScrollViewMiddleMouse)
    imap <middlemouse> <plug>(ScrollViewMiddleMouse)

    " Add support for dragging scrollbars with the right mouse button
    nmap <rightmouse> <plug>(ScrollViewRightMouse)
    vmap <rightmouse> <plug>(ScrollViewRightMouse)
    imap <rightmouse> <plug>(ScrollViewRightMouse)

    " Add support for dragging scrollbars with the x1 mouse button
    nmap <x1mouse> <plug>(ScrollViewX1Mouse)
    vmap <x1mouse> <plug>(ScrollViewX1Mouse)
    imap <x1mouse> <plug>(ScrollViewX1Mouse)

    " Add support for dragging scrollbars with the x2 mouse button
    nmap <x2mouse> <plug>(ScrollViewX2Mouse)
    vmap <x2mouse> <plug>(ScrollViewX2Mouse)
    imap <x2mouse> <plug>(ScrollViewX2Mouse)

5. Issues                                  *scrollview-issues*

Synchronization Issues ~
                                           *scrollview-synchronization-issues*
* Scrollbars can become out-of-sync after window arrangement actions that are
  not followed by a scroll event. For example, this can be seen by starting
  `nvim`, issuing |:help|, then typing `<ctrl-w>J` to move the help window to
  the bottom of the screen. This could be resolved if there was an event that
  is triggered by the window arrangement actions. |:ScrollViewRefresh|, or
  scrolling can be used to refresh the scrollbars.
  - Workaround: Remap the problematic key sequences accordingly. >
    nmap <c-w>H <c-w>H<plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)
    nmap <c-w>J <c-w>J<plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)
    nmap <c-w>K <c-w>K<plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)
    nmap <c-w>L <c-w>L<plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)
<    This won't resolve the issue in all cases (e.g., when using |:wincmd|).

* Scrollbars become out-of-sync when the mouse wheel is used to scroll a
  non-current window. This is because the |WinScrolled| event only corresponds
  to the current window. The scrollbars can be refreshed with
  |:ScrollViewRefresh|, scrolling, or by changing the current window.
  - Workaround: Remap the problematic key sequences accordingly. >
    nmap <scrollwheelup> <scrollwheelup><plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)
    nmap <scrollwheeldown> <scrollwheeldown><plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)

* Scrollbars become out-of-sync after fold commands when using a
  |scrollview-mode| that accounts for folds. Because there are no |autocmd-events|
  for folding, the plugin is unable to refresh the scrollbars.
  - Workaround: Remap the problematic fold command key sequences accordingly,
    depending on the fold commands you use. >
    nmap zo zo<plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)
    nmap zc zc<plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)

Error Message Issues ~
                                           *scrollview-error-message-issues*
* When attempting to close the last window in a tab with |:close| or
  `<ctrl-w>c`, with the scrollbar displayed, and at least one other tab, the
  following error is shown: >
    E5601: Cannot close window, only floating window would remain
<  Neovim Issue #11440 is the corresponding issue, opened November 23, 2019.
  - Workaround 1: Use |:quit|, |ZZ|, |ZQ|, or another command that quits the
    current window (as opposed to a window-closing command).
  - Workaround 2: Use |:only| or `<ctrl-w>o` on the last window of the tab,
    which has the side-effect of closing all floating windows (including
    scrollbars). A subsequent window-closing command works without error.
  - Workaround 3: Use |:tabclose|.
  - Workaround 4: Remap the problematic key sequence accordingly. >
    nnoremap <silent> <c-w>c
          \ <cmd>silent! ScrollViewDisable<cr>
          \<cmd>execute "normal! \<c-w>c"<cr>
          \<cmd>silent! ScrollViewEnable<cr>
<    This won't resolve the issue in all cases (e.g., when using |:close| or
    |:wincmd|). |<Plug>| mappings cannot be used, as they require recursive maps,
    and <c-w>c would infinitely recurse, as its usage on the right-hand-side
    is not at the beginning (see |recursive_mapping| for details).

* Deleting a buffer with |:bdelete|, when it's the only visible buffer and there
  are multiple buffers on the buffer list, results in the following error
  (with duplicate lines, as shown): >
    E444: Cannot close last window
    E444: Cannot close last window
<  The buffer may not be deleted from the buffer list. Neovim Issue #13628 is
  the corresponding issue, opened December 28, 2020.
  - Workaround 1: Use |:only| or `<ctrl-w>o`, which has the side-effect of closing
    all floating windows (including scrollbars). A subsequent |:bdelete| command
    works without error.
  - Workaround 2: Create a `Bdelete` command that avoids the issue. >
    command Bdelete
          \ silent! ScrollViewDisable
          \ | bdelete
          \ | silent! ScrollViewEnable
